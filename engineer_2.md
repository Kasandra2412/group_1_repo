Lab report 1 (Molecular Fingerprints)

Paper received from biologist #2 (Yiwei)

I attempted to run this using Python with RDKit and LightGBM. However, the reproduction was not successful because I ran into a problem: Installing CD-HIT and LGBM in my local environment was very difficult due to dependency conflicts.

Lab report 2 (ColabFold)

Paper received from biologist #2 (Fahad)

I ran the Colab notebook provided in the paper and it runs successfully.

Lab report 3 (BioBB)

Paper received from biologist #2 (Fahad)

I tried to reproduce the work, but it turned out to be more of a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks rather than a traditional research paper. The notebooks cover various biomolecular simulation workflows and are designed for demonstration and learning. Because it is mainly a tutorial collection with examples and live environments, I could not reproduce it in the usual sense.

Lab report 4 (Protein Solubility)

Paper received from biologist #2 (Fahad)

I tried to reproduce the results from the paper. I followed the steps described and used the available code. However, some files and datasets were missing, and several links, including the GitHub repository, did not work. Because of this, I could not fully reproduce the results.
