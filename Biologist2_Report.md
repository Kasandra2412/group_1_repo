This paper, explores how to predict what peptides do using computational methods. The authors discuss whether simple, local structural features of molecules can work as well as more complex models built around long-range interactions. They show that molecular fingerprints combined with a machine learning model can outperform advanced deep learning methods on many peptide-prediction datasets. 



This paper relates to our class because our course emphasizes using computational tools on genomic biological data. While the paper is not purely genomics, it deals with molecular/peptides and computational analysis of biological data. It uses machine learning and data analysis, and I think these are all key parts of our course's curriculum. Also it's a newly published paper so the data won't be out of date.
