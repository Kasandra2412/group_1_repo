# Biologist Report 1 â€“ ColabFold (Protein Structure Prediction)

## Paper Information
**Title:** ColabFold: making protein folding accessible to all  
**Authors:** Mirdita, SchÃ¼tze et al., *Nature Methods* (2022)  
**Article Link:** [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01488-1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01488-1)

**Colab Notebook:** [AlphaFold2.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)  
**Website:** [https://colabfold.mmseqs.com](https://colabfold.mmseqs.com)

## Platform
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook (runs fully in browser with GPU)

## Summary of the Paper
ColabFold simplifies AlphaFold2 protein structure prediction into an easy-to-run notebook.  
It combines MMseqs2 sequence search with AlphaFold2â€™s model for fast 3D folding of proteins or complexes.  
This method makes high-accuracy protein folding available to anyone without special hardware or installations.

## Why It Fits Our Theme
This paper provides an open, runnable notebook that aligns with our engineering teamâ€™s Jupyter setup and produces clear biological outputs (3D structures â†’ function).  
It connects computational modeling with biological interpretation
